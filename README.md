# UNOFFICIAL Risk: Legacy Foundry VTT Port

## How it works
Troops and HQs are on the Actors layer, all stickers and scars are on the Tiles layer. 

### Setting up a world
You'll be able to choose between "Original" or "Advanced". 
Original is the orignal board, the advanced variant is the one found on Board Game Geek 

Go to system settings to open packs. You'll need to open the 'base' pack to import the first set of entries. 

### Factions
Faction Character sheets are in the Actors Directory. You can drag powers and cards on top of them to grant those to the specific faction.

### Troops
To place troops, simply drag the appropriate troops from Actors Directory onto the board

### Stickers (Scars)
There's the *exact* amount of copies of stickers as are in the base game in folders like "sticker sheet". Simply delete the entry when you place it to keep track of how many are left. 


### Macros
There's a set of helpful macros
- Draw Territory/Mission/Event Card Macros
- Draw Scars
- Reset Games
- Setup Coin Cards
- Update Territory Value

# Suggested Foundry Modules:
